  return `I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and
  intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in
  less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of
  Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full
  financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade.
  Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both
  earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled financially. The other
  would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of
  millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other left bills to
  be paid.
  Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered me
  advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in
  education but did not recommend the same course of study.
  If I had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having
  two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man
  and one of a poor man.
  Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself
  thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The problem was that
  the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man was not yet poor. Both were just
  starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families.
  But they had very different points of view about money.
  For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root of all evil.”
  The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”
  As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult.
  I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the sameI wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same
  things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly about money, was so
  extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start thinking for long
  periods of time about what each was saying.
  Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such
  as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same question of the other dad’s
  statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I
  agree with that.” Or to simply reject the point of view by saying, “The old man
  doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved
  forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a
  process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long
  run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.
  One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle
  class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in
  school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can poor
  parents tell their child about money? They simply say, “Stay in school and study
  hard.” The child may graduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s
  financial programming and mindset.
  Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and
  professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart bankers,
  doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades may struggle financially
  all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part to highly
  educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with
  little or no training in the subject of money.
  Today I often wonder what will soon happen when we have millions of
  people who need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent upon
  their families or the government for financial support. What will happen when
  Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if
  teaching children about money continues to be left to parents—most of whom
  will be, or already are, poor?
  Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to
  think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the
  power and effect of one’s thoughts on one’s life. For example, one dad had a
  habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used.
  He insisted I ask, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a
  question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-
  to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can’t
  afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question “How can I afford
  it?” your brain is put to work. He did not mean that you should buy everythingit?” your brain is put to work. He did not mean that you should buy everything
  you want. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful
  computer in the world. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I
  exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that
  automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.
  Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of
  putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the other had a habit of
  exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger
  financially, and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a person
  who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who sits on
  the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances
  for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.
  My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way they thought.
  One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less
  fortunate. The other said, “Taxes punish those who produce and reward those
  who don’t produce.”
  One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to
  work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good
  company to buy.”
  One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you kids.” The
  other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.”
  One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner table, while
  the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal.
  One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take risks.” The
  other said, “Learn to manage risk.”
  One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset.”
  The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest
  investment, you’re in trouble.”
  Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other
  paid his bills last.
  One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and
  your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans,
  medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and other perks. He was impressed
  with two of his uncles who joined the military and earned a retirement-and-
  entitlement package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the
  idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He
  also loved the tenure system available through the university. The idea of job
  protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job.protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, at times, than the job.
  He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the government, and I’m entitled to
  these benefits.”
  The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the
  entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially needy people. He
  was emphatic about being financially competent.
  One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created investments. One
  dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé so I could find a good job. The
  other taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could
  create jobs.
  Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the
  effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed that people really do shape
  their lives through their thoughts.
  For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And that
  prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to
  himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man, and rich people don’t
  do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback, he
  continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by saying,
  “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary.
  Poor is eternal.”
  My poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or “Money doesn’t
  matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”
  The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it
  became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be aware of my
  thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was poor, not
  because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but because
  of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy having two fathers, I became acutely
  aware of being careful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Should
  I listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad?`
